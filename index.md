## Subscriptions

<img src="https://github.com/Tubefeeder/Tubefeeder/blob/master/screenshots/tubefeeder_screenshot_subscriptions.png?raw=true" alt="Subscriptions" width="400"/>

Subscribe to a channel.
You can also import your subscriptions from [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/).
You can subscribe to any channel from the supported platforms.

## Supported Platforms

Currently supported are:

- Youtube (using Piped as the backend to prevent throttling)
- Peertube
- Lbry

## Choose a video player

Play the videos in the player of your choice. By default, [mpv](https://mpv.io/) is chosen,
but this can be changed easily. Look at [these instructions](https://www.tubefeeder.de/wiki/different-player.html).

__Note__: Currently mpv with youtube-dl does not play nice with lbry-videos.

__Note__: Depending on the player you use, you may not be able to play videos from some platforms.
